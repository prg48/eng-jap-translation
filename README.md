# eng-jap-translation

The project is model training and evaluation part of the final year **Individual Project** on **English-Japanese NLP translation**. 

## Data pre-processing
The data pre-processing scripts can be found in [data-preprocessing-scripts](/data-preprocessing-scripts/). The data pre-processing was first tried on local PC using the [JparaCrawlv2.0](https://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/lirg/jparacrawl/), [JparaCrawlv3.0](https://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/lirg/jparacrawl/), and [JESC](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/jesc/) corpuses. However, due to the large sizes of the files, it could not be pre-processed on the local PC. Thus, **Goole Colab Pro** was used as it provided **80GB RAM** and **40GB GPU** capability.
